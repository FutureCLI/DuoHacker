# Changelog
# **🔔v1.5 – Course Validation Update**
# ✨ New Features
- **Vi → En Course Validation**
  - Added automatic course detection before starting **Farm XP** and **Farm All**.
  - If your course is not **Vi → En**, a notification banner appears at the top of the screen.
  - Banner displays your **current course** and instructs you to switch to **Vi → En** on duolingo.com.
  - Banner **auto-dismisses after 8 seconds** or can be closed manually.
- **Targeted validation scope**
  - Only applies to **Farm XP (499 XP)** and **Farm All** — they use the ⁨`en-vi-the-passport`⁩ endpoint which requires Vi → En.
  - **Farm XP Global (110 XP)**, Gems, Streak, League, and Quest are not affected.
# 🧠 Logic Improvements
- Course check runs **before** any API request — prevents silent failures or 404 errors.
- Reads from ⁨`userInfo.fromLanguage`⁩ and ⁨`userInfo.learningLanguage`⁩ — no extra API calls.
- Banner is singleton — no duplicate notifications.
# 🎨 UI / UX
- Duolingo-style banner with **orange/yellow gradient**, owl icon 🦉, and slide-down animation.
- Current course shown as a **tag** (e.g. ⁨`Fr → En`⁩) next to the required ⁨`Vi → En`⁩.
- Close button with hover effect. Responsive on desktop & mobile.
# 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Fixed **Farm XP** silently failing when course was not Vi → En.
- Fixed **Farm All** repeatedly sending failed requests on an incompatible course.
# ⚙️ Technical
- Added ⁨`checkViEnCourse()`⁩ guard — returns ⁨`true`⁩ if Vi → En, ⁨`false`⁩ otherwise and shows the banner.
- Guard runs before any state mutation (⁨`isRunning`⁩, timers, UI) so a blocked start stays clean for retry.
